# TitanicClassification
The well known Titanic Dataset test
As always there are some comments within the code as to why i did certain things
This is my first time using logistic regression
If there are any suggestions to how i could improve the precision feel free to comment.
I created this as if Xtrain was the entirety of the data. That is one of the things I will change moving forward.
